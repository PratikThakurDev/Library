# Library

This is my 9th project built while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
Itâ€™s a simple Library App where users can add books, mark them as read/unread, and remove them from the list.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Add a new book with title, author, and optional image
- Mark a book as **read** or **unread** using a checkbox
- Delete a book from the library
- Modal form for adding books with validation
- Responsive UI built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Form input validation
- Modal UI design and logic
- Managing dynamic data in the browser

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3
